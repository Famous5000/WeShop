# WeShop
Public Github for the [WeShop Workshop Addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3372649728).

## Why this?
The author of the addon has requested for me to create the GitHub repo for the legacy workshop linked [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3342435610). This is the addon in the state before I took over and started working on it. The public branch is [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3372649728), and the BETA branch is [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3372597864).

Latest Stable branch has up to commit #10 installed.
